**Tools**
- Python pandas | matplotlib | seaborn

## Project 2: Housing Price Prediction using Regression Model
**Aim**
- Develop a regression model to predict resale values of residential properties in Ames, US and generate insights on features affecting property price.

**Methodology**
- Feature engineering was done to generate additional relevant features.
- Feature selection was done to reduce collinearity and remove unimportant features.
- Linear regression, Ridge, Lasso and Elastic Net were used to predict sale price.

**Tools**
- scikit-learn | pandas | matplotlib | seaborn

## Project 3: Natural Language Processing - Classification and Sentiment Analysis of Reddit Posts
**Aim**
- Analyze Google and Appleâ€™s user sentiments on social media (Reddit) and build a text classification model to understand contents of discussion

**Methodology**
- Webscraping of Reddit posts using API
- Explore a variety of classification algorithm (probabilistic model, distance-based algorithm, tree based algorithm and ensemble models), using MLFlow and PyCaret to keep track of experiment results
- Sentiment analysis

**Tools**
- scikit-learn | MLFlow | PyCaret | Vader | spaCy | Hugging Face Transformer

## Project 4: Virus Presence Prediction and Cost-Benefit Analysis
**Aim**
- 1) Build a classification model with time-series and geographical data to predict virus presence in mosquitoes
- 2) Run a cost-benefit analysis of mosquito control measures to optimize effectiveness while minimizing costs.

**Methodology**
- Address imbalanced classes using techniques like random under sampling, random over sampling, SMOTE (synthetic minority over-sampling technique)
- Visualize geographical distribution of mosquito breeding sites and locations of mosquito control measures

**Tools**
- matplotlib | plotly |
